*Fetch and Display User Data
 This is a mini project built as part of my web development internship.  
 It demonstrates how to use JavaScript's Fetch API to retrieve data from a public API and display it on a webpage.

*Project Overview
  Fetches user information from [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
  Displays each user's name, email, and address
  Handles network or API errors using a `catch` block
  Includes a "Reload Users" button to re-fetch data
  Styled using CSS with a clean, card-based layout
